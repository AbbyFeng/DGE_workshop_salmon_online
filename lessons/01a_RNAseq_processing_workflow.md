## RNA-seq processing workflow

Before we get started with differential gene expression, it's important to know where the count matrix came from. In this lesson we will briefly discuss the RNA-processing pipeline and the **different steps we take to go from raw sequencing reads to count matrix**.

### 1. RNA Extraction and library preparation

Before RNA can be sequenced, it must first be extracted and separated from its cellular environment prepared into a cDNA library. There are a number of steps involved which are outlined in the figure below. We briefly describe some of these steps, but also encourage you to access the resources linked at the end of this lesson for more detailed information.
