## Learning Objectives 

* Detailed description of dataset
* Numbered descriptions of workflow steps leading up to count matrix
* Link out to Illumina video


## RNA-seq

Before we get started with differential gene expression, it's important to know where the count matrix came from. In this lesson we will briefly discuss the RNA-processing pipeline and the different steps we take to go from raw sequencing reads to count matrix.
