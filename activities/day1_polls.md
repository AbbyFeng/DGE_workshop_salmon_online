1. Which of the following is NOT part of the library preparation process?

a. Reverse transcription
b. Fragmentation
c. Hybridization
d. PolyA selection


2.In Illumina's sequencing by synthesis process, each cycle incorporates a fluorophore labelled dNTP which is excited by a laser. Each dNTP has a distinct excitatory signal emission which is captured by cameras. The number of bases incorporated is equal to the total length of the cDNA fragment being sequenced.

a. True
b. False

3. Lightweight alignment tools are those which avoid base-to-base genomic alignment of the reads. These tools not only provide quantification estimatesÂ faster than older tools, but also show improvements in accuracy. Which of the following tools is not a lightweight alignment tool?

a. Sailfish
b. STAR
c. Salmon
d. Kallisto

The output of a lightweight alignment tool is a BAM file.

a. True
b. False

Which of the following statements about RNA-seq quality control is not true?

1. Quality checks need to be performed on each individual sample and metrics should be compared across samples in a dataset for consistency.
2. FASTQC is a tool used to evaluate the raw sequence reads.
3. Mapping quality tools like Qualimap require genomic coordinate information as input.
4. If a sample exhibits low quality scores at any one of the checkpoints it should be discarded before proceeding to differential gene expression analysis.
