1. Which of the following is NOT part of the library preparation process?

	1. Reverse transcription
	1. Fragmentation
	1. **Immunoprecipitation**
	1. PolyA selection

 
1. In Illumina's sequencing by synthesis process, each cycle incorporates a fluorophore labelled dNTP which is excited by a laser. Each dNTP has a distinct excitatory signal emission which is captured by cameras. The number of bases incorporated is equal to the total length of the cDNA fragment being sequenced. OR *"The number of bases incorporated during Illumina's sequencing by synthesis process is equal to the total length of the cDNA fragment being sequenced."*

	1. True
	2. **False**

1. Lightweight alignment tools are those which avoid base-to-base genomic alignment of the reads. These tools not only provide quantification estimatesÂ faster than older tools, but also show improvements in accuracy. Which of the following tools is not a lightweight alignment tool? OR *"Lightweight alignment tools avoid base-to-base genomic alignment of the reads. These tools provide quantification estimates faster than older tools, and also show improvements in accuracy. Which of the following tools is not a lightweight alignment tool?"*

	1. Sailfish
	1. **STAR**
	1. Salmon
	1. Kallisto

1. The output of a lightweight alignment tool is a BAM file.

	1. True
	1. **False**

1. Which of the following statements about RNA-seq quality control is not true?

	1. Quality checks need to be performed on each individual sample and metrics should be compared across samples in a dataset for consistency.
	1. FASTQC is a tool used to evaluate the raw sequence reads.
	1. Mapping quality tools like Qualimap require genomic coordinate information as input.
	1. **If a sample exhibits low quality scores at any one of the checkpoints it should be discarded before proceeding to differential gene expression analysis.**
   
5. For the majority of bulk RNA-seq experiments, higher sequencing depth is more important than the number of replicates.

	1. True
	1. **False**
