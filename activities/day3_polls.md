1. Please choose the option that is NOT TRUE.

- Generally, the gene dispersion estimates should decrease with increasing mean expression values.
- Generally, the gene dispersion estimates should cluster around the line of best fit.
- Gene dispersion plots are a good way to examine whether the data are a good fit to the DESeq2 model.
- A good gene dispersion plot indicates a higher likelihood of detecting a lot of differentially expressed genes.
- A worrisome gene dispersion plot could be a result of outlier samples or contamination.
- A worrisome gene dispersion plot indicates that we should be more skeptical of our significant DE genes.
