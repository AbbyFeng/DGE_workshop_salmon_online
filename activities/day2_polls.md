5. The following statements are describing the characteristics of RNA-seq count data. Select the statement that is incorrect.   
  a. Count data has large dynamic range, with no upper limit for expression.  
  b. For genes with low mean expression we observe a range of variance values.  
  c. For genes with high mean expression, the variance is less than the mean.  
  d. Count data follows a negative binomial distribution.
