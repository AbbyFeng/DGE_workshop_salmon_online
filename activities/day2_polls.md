1. The following statements are describing the characteristics of RNA-seq count data. Select the statement that is incorrect.   
  
  1. Count data has large dynamic range, with no upper limit for expression.  
  1. For genes with low mean expression we observe a range of variance values.  
  1. For genes with high mean expression, the variance is less than the mean.  
  1. Count data follows a negative binomial distribution.

2. Increasing the number of replicates enables more precise estimates of group means, and increases our statistical power to call differentially expressed genes correctly.  
  
  1. True  
  1. False
   
3. Which of the following factors does NOT need to be taken into consideration when comparing expression of a given gene between samples? 
  
  1. Sequencing depth  
  1. Gene length  
  1. RNA composition

4. Which of the following normalization methods are utilized by DESeq2's model?
  
  1. CPM (counts per million)  
  1. TPM (transcripts per kilobase million)  
  1. RPKM (reads per kilobase of exon per million reads/fragments mapped)  
  1. median of ratios
  
5. True or False: RPKM is the preferred normalization method to compare the expression of a given gene between samples.  
  1. True  
  1. False

6. True or False: The presence of differentially expressed genes between samples can alter the size factor (normalization factor).   
  1. True  
  1. False
