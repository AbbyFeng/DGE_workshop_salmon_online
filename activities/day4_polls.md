1. True/False. Among the functional analysis methods, GSEA is better than over-representation analysis for exploring enriched processes or pathways when there are few differentially expressed genes.

	1. True
	1. False

1. True/False. We identify RNA splicing-related terms as significant in both our over-representation and GSEA analyses. We can conclude that RNA splicing is affected by our condition of interest.

	1. True
